To store memory, the VM has a main stack, a seconds stack, and it allows you to store variables.

These are the types of data that can be stored as variables, or on the stack:
*lists,
*binaries.

Lists can store other lists, and binaries.
If binaries are 32 bits long, then we can do arithmetic on them.
