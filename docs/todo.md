We should have 2 types of functions.
One for fast recursion, and the other for merkelizing the code.

Lisp should have:
list
cons
car
append
defmacro

We should add syntax for define like this
(define (newFunc A B) (+ (* A A) B))

maybe we should add a "do" command, which executes all the things on a list, and returns the last thing.
