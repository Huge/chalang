we should never append something to the script.
Like how function calls currently work.
If we do that, then we need to do expensive memory allocation and garbage collection on the order of the length of the script.

The return stack is a good thing, because we can use it to avoid appending to the script.
But, we could also cut the script into pieces, and append the pieces as a list.
